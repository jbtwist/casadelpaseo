    "castleVisitTitle": "Guided tour of Bury al-Hamma",
    "castleVisitDescP1": "The Castle of Bury al-Hamma, located in the village of Baños de la Encina, is one of the best-preserved Muslim fortresses in Spain and a remarkable example of Almohad architecture. Its striking crenellated walls, featuring fifteen towers, date back to the 12th century and seamlessly adapt to the rugged terrain of Cerro del Cueto. Constructed with rammed earth mixed with lime, soil, and water, the structure has withstood the test of time almost unscathed.",
    "castleVisitDescP2": "The site reveals evidence of human settlement as far back as the Copper Age, with Iberian remnants and funerary structures found within its grounds, alongside a sophisticated Almohad urban design. After its capture by Ferdinand III in 1225, the Torre del Homenaje (Keep) was added, blending Christian and Muslim elements. Declared a National Monument in 1931, the castle stands as a testament to its historical and strategic significance in controlling the mountain passes of Sierra Morena."
